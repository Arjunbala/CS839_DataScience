# Movies Data
We decided to extract movie information from two popular movie rating websites, [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/). We extracted 3000 tuples from both these websites and stored in two csv files in tabular format:
1. [IMDB](imdb.csv)
2. [Metacritic](metacritic.csv)
